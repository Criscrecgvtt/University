h1: Number of misplaced tiles

h2: Sum of Eucledian distances of the tiles from their goal positions

h3: Sum of Manhattan distances of the tiles from their goal positions

h4: Number of tiles out of row + Number of tiles out of column

h5: n-Max Swap
Assume you can swap any tile with the ‘space’. Use the cost of the
optimal solution to this problem as a heuristic for the 8-puzzle.

h6: n-Swap
Represent the ‘space’ as a tile and assume you can swap any two tiles.
Use the cost of the optimal solution to this problem as a heuristic
for the 8-puzzle.

h7: Nilsson’s Sequence Score h(n) = P(n) + 3 S(n)
P(n): Sum of Manhattan distances of each tile from its proper position
S(n): A sequence score obtained by checking around the non-central
squares in turn, allotting 2 for every tile not followed by its proper
successor and 0 for every other tile, except that a piece in the
center scores 1
